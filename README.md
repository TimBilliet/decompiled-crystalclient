# Working decompiled forge version of crystalclient

## Things that currently don't work (yet)
- alt manager (never worked in the original one anyway)
- buggy cloak rendering

## How to generate a working jar
1. Run the gradle task "reobfShadowJar"
2. You can find the jar file at build/libs/client-1.0.jar
