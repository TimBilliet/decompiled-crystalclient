# Half working decompiled version of crystalclient

## Things that currently don't work (yet)
- schematica material sorting & some block transparency
- scrollpane isn't cut off in gui
- gui scale (gui is way too big)
- custom crosshair
- optifine compatibility
- alt manager (never worked in the original one anyway)

## How to generate a working jar
1. Run the gradle task "reobfShadowJar"
2. You can find the jar file at build/libs/client-1.0.jar
